# Assignment 3 – Linked List Manipulation (Java)

This project implements a driver program for Assignment 3 using a provided `Node` data structure.

## Overview
The program reads integers into an array, constructs a linked list using only the `Node` class, and performs a rotation on the linked list based on user input. No `LinkedList` class or related methods are used, and the `Node` class is assumed to be provided and unmodified.

## Implementation
The program contains:
- **Method 1**: Creates a linked list from an array of integers by placing even numbers first, followed by odd numbers, while preserving their original order.
- **Method 2**: Rotates the linked list by a user-specified number of positions with proper error checking.
- **Main method**: Serves as the driver by reading input, invoking both methods, and printing the linked list before and after rotation.

## Notes
- Only the driver program is included in this repository.
- The `Node` class is assumed to be provided externally and is not submitted.
- The solution strictly follows the assignment requirements.
